---------

This is an independent record repository which keeps track of what utilities I have ported to Native Client. The Native Client is a sandbox technology from Google which allows the developer to run native C/C++ code (Java supposedly later) efficiently and securely in the browser, giving the code complete access to the CPU, independent of the OS, provided you have Chromium/Chrome.

List of Projects
----------------

1. GNU Awk, or gawk 4.1.1 [Completed]
2. Perl
    I intend to do Perl as a GSoC project this year. This one is still incomplete, and is supposed to be done during the summer. I have been selected :) More details on [Melange](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/agaurav77/5649050225344512).
