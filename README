NACLPORTS

This is an independent record repository which keeps track of what utilities I have ported to Native Client. Native Client is a sandbox technology from Google which allows the developer to run native C/C++ code (Java supposedly later) efficiently and securely in the browser, giving the code complete access to the CPU, independent of the OS, provided you have Chromium/Chrome. Some of these ports have been accepted at [5].
